[Sam Altman: how to be successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

1. Compund yourself 
    + You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajector
    + Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.

2. Have almost too much self-belief
    + The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.

    + Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.  

    + Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. Now I try to always listen to criticism with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. **Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.**

3. Learn to think independently
    + **Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas** is fun, and **finding people to exchange them** with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to **find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world**.

    + “I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.

    + One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution.

    + Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.

4. Get good at “sales”
    + Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for **communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language**.

    + Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice, though it feels distasteful.

    + My other big sales tip is to **show up in person whenever it’s important**. 

5. Make it easy to take risks
    + It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. 
    
    + Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. 
    
    + Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.

    + When you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this.

6. Focus
    + It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours.

    + Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly.

7. Work hard
    + You will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.

    + **One of the great joys in life** is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. 

    + You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is **to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with**.

    + Work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.

    + One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career.

8. Be bold
    + If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.

    + Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.

9. Be willful
    + A big secret is that **you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time**—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.

    + Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well. 

    + “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed.

    + To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice.

10. Be hard to compete with
    + The best way to become difficult to compete with is to **build up leverage**. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.

11. Build a network
    + The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.

    + An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can.

    + One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. 
    
    + You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.

    + The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.

    + The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly **looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment**.

    + Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.

12. You get rich by owning things
    + Almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary. 
    
    + **You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value**. This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.

    + The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale. 

13. Be internally driven
    + The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. 

    + This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it. 

    + you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.
